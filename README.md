## Install

You can install the Globalization Pipeline extension by directly downloading the .vsix package from [releases](https://github.ibm.com/gp/gp-vscode-plugin/releases) and then from the command line do one of the following:

+ If you are using Bluemix Code, then run **bluemix-code g11n-0.0.1.vsix** 
- If you are using Visual Studio Code, then run **code g11n-0.0.1.vsix**

## Requirements

You must first create an instance of the Globalization Pipeline service on Bluemix before you can use this extension to work with translation bundles.

## Extension Settings

To use the extension copy over your VCAP credential settings for the Globalization Pipeline service and fill in the appropriate fields.

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `g11n.userId`: The Globalization Pipeleine service userId
* `g11n.password`: The Globalization Piepeline service password
* `g11n.instanceId`: The Globalization Pipeline service instanceId
* `g11n.url`: The Globalization Pipeline service url end point
* `g11n.sourceLanguage`: The source language of the content that you will upload to the service, e.g. *en*, must be a valid BCP 47 language code. By default this value is set to *en*
* `g11n.targetLanguages`: An array of target lanaguges that your bundle will be translated into, e.g., *['es', 'fr']*, must be valid BCP 47 language codes

## Usage

In the command palette `(F1)` type Globalization Pipeline you should see the following commands:

+ Globalization Pipeline - Create Bundle
- Globalization Pipeline - Upload Source Bundle
* Globalization Pipeline - Delete Bundle

When you use these commands a connection will automatically be made to the Globalization Pipeline service on IBM Bluemix to complete your requested action.
When you upload your source bundle content the extension will automatically detect the file format and will perform any necessary transformation for you. 
Currently only Java properties, JSON, and i18n AMD resource bundles are supported. To upload bundle content make sure the content is being displayed in the active
edit screen and then invoke the extension.

## Accessing bundles

The best way to access the bundles from your application is to use one of the Globalization Pipeline's programming language SDKs. 
Many programming languages such as: Java, Node.js, Angular, and Python are supported. You can find a complete list of the SDKs [here](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/gp-common)
